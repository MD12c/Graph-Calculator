# Graph

Graph is a C++ application that renders mathematical functions using OpenGL.
It supports interactive visualization of functions and a simple GUI for function input.

This is my first OpenGL project which I did for learning graphics programing and software architecture.


## Features

- OpenGL-based rendering
- Function plotting (such as x^2, sin(x), sqrt(x) ... )
- Grid and axis rendering
- ImGui-based user interface
